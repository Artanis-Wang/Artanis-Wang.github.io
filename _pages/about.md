I am a direct Ph.D. student (Class of 2023) at the College of Computer Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology, advised by [Dezun Dong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=tBd50zkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and co-supervised by [Fei Lei].(https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8614-933X). I am part of the HiNA (High Performance Networking and Architecture) Lab and work closely with [Feng Guangnan](http://blog.sysu.tech/cv/), a postdoc at Sun Yat-sen University. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Chongqing University in June 2023.
